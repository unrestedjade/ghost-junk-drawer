Thank you for installing Tegra and Kadan! These ladies are Star Trek fan-characters; U.C. Davis students circa 2376, here to bum around your desktop and banter with each other. They're a an Ukagaka or Ghost, an interactive desktop pet. They can perform a few novelty functions such as emptying your recycling for you, checking your email (provided you configure it), but mostly they're here to stand around and talk your ear off. I hope you have fun playing with them! 

You'll need a working install of SSP for Windows to run this ghost. You can download it from the SSP website here (look for the pink button at the top left of the page): http://ssp.shillest.net/

To install Tegra and Kadan, open SSP, then drag the tegra_and_kadan.nar file onto the existing ghost (the SSP default ghost is Emily, an anime girl). After installation you can right-click Emily to open the SSP menu, then navigate to Change Ghost and select Tegra and Kadan to switch. If the SSP menu is displaying in Japanese, first navigate to the fourth option from the bottom to select the language.

CW: Broad-spectrum advisory that while this ghost is generally light-hearted, Tegra and Kadan may have discussions that are adult or upsetting (this goes triple for their "Mirrorverse" shell!) Discussions and interactions may include but aren't limited to sex/sexuality (Tegra is a Ferengi, c'mon now), violence and SA, war, fantasy racism, misogyny, queerphobia. The "Spa Day" shell also features some Barbie-style nonsexual nudity (given they're...in a spa, lol.)

To Control:

    T - Make Tegra and Kadan say something randomly.
    R - Make Tegra and Kadan repeat their last dialogue
    F1 - Open readme.txt (you're soaking in it now!)
    Double-click Tegra's torso - Open the primary ghost menu. Basic ghost functions like asking the gals to empty your recycle bin, adjust how often they speak, or play a simple game can be found here. 
    Right-click Tegra's torso - Open SSP menu. You can find options to switch between installed shells or add/remove dressup items from Tegra here, among other functions.
    Double-click Kadan's torso - Open the secondary ghost menu. You can ask Kadan how the pair feel about you here, or email me a bug report if you find an issue.
    Right-click Kadan's torso - Open the secondary SSP menu. Dressup options for Kadan along with a couple other minor things are found here.
    Ctrl+Shift+F12 - Return Tegra or Kadan into view if they've been moved offscreen.

    Arranging Tegra and Kadan to your liking on your desktop is as easy and clicking and dragging them. Same with their speech balloons!

    Tegra and Kadan also have a couple hitboxes on their heads that you can mouse over to "pet" those areas to trigger dumb little dialogue exchanges. Be careful, though! If you double-click, you'll smack them instead, which may make them upset with you. Be mean to them long enough, and their interactions will change. Their interations will also change if you're kind to them long enough, and they'll become chattier and more open with you. :)


I'm not much of a programmer, but I love developing these two. Please reach out on the off chance there's anything you'd like to see as far as features or shell options!
