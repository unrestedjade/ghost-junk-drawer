	"I went out with a bolian this one time. Did you know their bodily fluids are, like, crazy acidic? \w8\n\n[half]\i[253]\i[202]Yeah, that was a super awkward trip to the doctor...\i[153]"
	"Caitians are so soft and fuzzy! \w8\n\n[half]\i[253]I think I might be allergic, though. Sad face\i[152]..."
	"I got coffee with this guy who claimed women only like him for his brains. \w8\w8\i[252]\i[406]\i[407]His cranium was totally see-through! \w8\w6\n\n[half]\i[410]\i[405]He was so funny,\w4 I wish I'd gotten his comm frequency...\i[158]"
	"Did you know the more spiritual bajorans do this thing where they grab your ear to...\i[37]\i[212]\w8check your vibes, I guess? \w8\i[210]\n\n[half]And a lot of them don't know doing that means something totally different in ferengi culture? \w8\n\n[half]So.\i[406]\i[407]\w8 Embarrassing. \s[0]\i[253]\i[408]\i[403]\i[153]\w8\w8\w8\n\n[half]\s[0]\i[253]We both agreed to just, like, never speak of that whole misunderstanding again."
	"I ran into the cutest orion at the club not long ago! \w8\n\n[half]\i[252]\i[33]I wonder if she'll be there this weekend...?"
	"\i[252]So, like, the most adorable klingon threw a rock at my head. \i[37]\i[210]\w8I had to get treated for a concussion,\s[0]\i[32] but I was so flattered, you know?\i[160]"
	"\i[251]\i[32]This bolian, like, won't stop messaging me. So annoying! \i[406]\i[403]\w8As if I'd forget those chemical burns I got last time\i[201]... Not!\i[153]"
	"\i[410]\i[403]So this hu-mon told me he only dates girls with long hair...\i[254]\w8Weirdly specific fetish, but, like, okay...?\i[156]"
	"\i[406]\i[407]Like, this ferengi male had the nerve to ask me to dinner. \w8\w6If I wanted to date other ferengi I could have just stayed home, you know?\i[254]\i[406]\i[403]\i[201] \w8\w8Like, keep it moving, limp-lobes...\i[155]"

	"Rule 1:\nOnce you have their money...never give it back.,How mercenary.,No refunds! <3"
	"Rule 2:\nMoney is everything.,How bleak.,It kinda is when you think about it!"
	"Rule 3:\nNever spend more for an acquisition than you have to.,Surprisingly banal advice given how unhinged some of these are.,It's figuring out where ''have to'' ends up that's hard!"
	"Rule 4:\nSedition and treason are always profitable.,Certainly not in the Cardassian Union.,Ugh! No fun allowed in the Cardassian Union."
	"Rule 5:\nAlways exaggerate your estimates.,What's the point if everyone knows what you're doing?,So you have room to negotiate down!"
	"Rule 6:\nNever allow family to stand in the way of opportunity.,How unnatural.,It's not like all of these are *easy* to follow, ya know."
	"Rule 7:\nKeep your ears open.,You can close your ears?,What? You can't?"
	"Rule 8:\nSmall print leads to large risk.,A meditation on minding the subtle details.,You gotta pay attention and stuff!"
	"Rule 9:\nOpportunity plus instinct equals profit.,This lifestyle is exhausting to contemplate.,Keeping an ear up for interesting things is fun though!"
	"Rule 10:\nGreed is eternal.,For your species certainly.,\i[410]\i[403]Haha! Just ours. Totally. ;3"
	"Rule 13:\nAnything worth doing is worth doing for money.,If I substitute every mention of money for ''the state'' I can nearly stomach these.,Interpetation is as important as remembering them!"
	"Rule 14:\nSometimes the quickest way to find profits is to let them find you.,A reminder that patience is a virtue. All species seem to have an analog.,My family's super patient\i[201] and nothing's finding them."
	"Rule 15:\nDead men close no deals.,Your people's greed is outshined only by their cowardice.,\i[254]Yeah because getting bad-mouthed is so much worse than dying..."
	"Rule 16:\nA deal is a deal until a better one comes along.,I thought your civilization had quite an impressive body of legal code opposing this sentiment?,It says ''deal'' and not ''contract'' for a reason!"
	"Rule 17:\nA contract is a contract is a contract-- but only between ferengi.,A hint of some normal affinity for your kinsmen over other aliens?,Why would we be accountable to outsiders who don't get us anyway?"
	"Rule 18:\nA ferengi without profit is no ferengi at all.,What are women and the poor then?,That's kind of a heavy one...\i[152]"
	"Rule 19:\nSatisfaction is not guaranteed.,Hn! True words. Life it not meant for mere happiness.,\i[406]\i[407]Yeah! Life really sucks sometimes!"
	"Rule 20:\nHe who dives under the table today lives to profit tomorrow.,How detestable.,It works!"
	"Rule 21:\nNever place friendship over profit.,You all must lead incredibly atomized lives.,Replace ''profit'' with ''the state'' and you'd be totally on board.\i[155]"
	"Rule 22:\nA wise man can hear profit in the wind.,Do you really never think about anything else?,Well duh!\i[201] They're not called the Rules of Everything Else."
	"Rule 23:\nNothing is more important than your health except for your money.,Truly?,You can't go broke on medical bills and then go meet the Blessed Exchequer empty-handed. Right?"
	"Rule 27:\nThere's nothing more dangerous than an honest businessman.,I must confess this sounds like nonsense on its face.,This one's hard to explain to outsiders... \i[210]\i[410]\i[403]You'd have to read up on Drek-May-His-Name-Live-In-Infamy."
	"Rule 29:\nWhat's in it for me?,I have a feeling only a rather narrow set of answers to this is acceptable.,It's a question you gotta ask!"
	"Rule 30:\nConfidentiality equals profit.,You do seem oddly capable of discretion.,\i[252]Big ears are good\w5\i[251] and a big mouth is bad!\i[156]"
	"Rule 31:\nNever make fun of a ferengi's mother. Insult something he cares about instead.,Revolting.,\i[254]Aw don't take that one too serious.\w5\i[206] And don't say nasty things about my mom!\i[155]"
	"Rule 33:\nIt never hurts to suck up to the boss.,I have a feeling this goes beyond proper respect for one's superiors.,What's not proper about keeping your boss happy?"
	"Rule 34:\nWar is good for business.,I suppose.,I like the hu-mon version better!\w4\i[203]\i[402]\i[409] Go on and look up ''human Rule 34''...!\w4 *snrk!*\i[56]"
	"Rule 35:\nPeace is good for business.,Doesn't this directly contradict ''war is good for business''?,You're not scared of a little contradiction are you?"
	"Rule 37:\nThe early investor reaps the most interest.,Mathematically I suppose this is true.,As long as it's a sound investment in the first place. <3"
	"Rule 39:\nDon't tell customers more than they need to know.,I can agree with a warning not to volunteer information carelessly.,Oversharing is no good!"
	"Rule 40:\nShe can touch your lobes but never your latinum.,I'd wondered when we'd happen across some of that famed ferengi misogyny.,I just ignore the sucky rules. <3"
	"Rule 41:\nProfit is its own reward.,I suppose that is literally true.,I like the rules that explain themselves."
	"Rule 43:\nFeed your greed-- but not enough to choke it.,An actual caution toward self control? I'm shocked.,My grandma used to say if you try to eat the whole gree worm you get nothing but its teeth."
	"Rule 44:\nNever confuse luck for wisdom.,A rare glimmer of good counsel among the chaff.,This one's my favorite!"
	"Rule 45:\nExpand or die.,This would seem to be in conflict with Rule 43.,Yeah I think it's discussed in one of the commentaries\w4 but I never read them."
	"Rule 47:\nDon't trust a man wearing a better suit than your own.,Probably a fair assessment given your people's track record with pro-social behavior.,Mom said this one means females can't trust any males at all."
	"Rule 48:\nThe bigger the smile the sharper the knife.,This one is sensible.,Oh! We should run the Smiling Partner holonovels together sometime.\w3\i[253]\i[202]\i[406]\i[407] They're so scary!"
	"Rule 52:\nNever ask when you can take.,\i[406]\i[407]Is this why my things keep going missing?\i[158],There's no point asking to borrow something if you're just gonna say no!"
	"Rule 53:\nNever trust anybody taller than you.,That covers a great many people for the average ferengi.\i[156],That's the joke!"
	"Rule 54:\nRate times time equals profit.,Another banal statement of fact.,Technically it equals revenue. You gotta subtract expenses."
	"Rule 55:\nTake joy from profit and profit from joy.,Work does bring a sense of purpose.,The hu-mons say if you do what you love you never work a day in your life!"
	"Rule 57:\nGood customers are as rare as latinum-- treasure them.,I thought you all prided yourselves on being swindlers?,You gotta follow through most of the time or no one will do business with you at all!"
	"Rule 58:\nThere is no substitute for success.,You lot are certainly acheivement oriented.,Unlike cardassians?"
	"Rule 59:\nFree advice is seldom cheap.,I feel I'm taking a meaning from this as a cardassian that is not necessarily the intent.,Cardassians treat information like currency sometimes-- right?"
	"Rule 60:\nKeep your lies consistent.,By all accounts sound advice.,Easier said than done!"
	"Rule 62:\nThe riskier the road the greater the profit.,I suppose this is what passes for courage among you.,What's not brave about it?"
	"Rule 63:\nWork is the best therapy.,I know better than to agree wholeheartedly. However...,If you keep busy the existential dread can't set in!"
	"Rule 65:\nWin or lose there's always hupyrian beetle snuff.,A reminder to take solace in simple pleasures?,But that snuff is pretty bad for you..."
	"Rule 66:\nSomeone's always got bigger ears.,\i[201]Except possibly in Tegra's case.\i[156],\w4\i[408]\i[409]...Hey!!!\i[251] My ears are dainty and cute!\w3\i[202] Shut up!\i[152]"
	"Rule 68:\nRisk doesn't always equal reward.,A caution against overreaching one's grasp.,And not talking yourself into a bad idea!"
	"Rule 69:\nFerengi are not responsible for the stupidity of other races.,Do I sense a slight bitterness?,Hu-mons agree! I told a hu-mon about this rule once and they were like: ''nice''."
	"Rule 74:\nKnowledge equals profit.,Kowledge of what? That's the question.,You never know what might come in handy!"
	"Rule 77:\nIf you break it I'll charge you for it.,I sense a more profound warning in the subtext.,This rule shows up in tons of break-up songs!\i[157]"
	"Rule 79:\n:Beware the vulcan greed for knowledge.,Oddly specific. Did your two species' first contact go poorly?,I dunno!\w4\i[212] Something about a murder or corpse desecration I think?\w4\i[203] Can't help with this one. <3"
	"Rule 82:\nThe flimsier the product the higher the price.,A caution against foolhardy assumptions.,Gotta be able to spot a load of junk when you see it."
	"Rule 85:\nNever let the competition know what you're thinking.,It's usually best to keep one's hand close to the vest in any case.,Yeah! Be mysterious!\w4\i[203]\i[410]\i[405] Like me!\i[160]"
	"Rule 87:\nLearn the customer's weaknesses to better take advantage of them.,So many of these read like modified war aphorisms.,\i[202]\i[406]\i[407]We wage war across a negotiating table instead of a battlefield!\i[156]"

	  //Another use for these envelopes is to shortcut certain long lines of SakuraScript you don't want to have to keep typing. A good example is if you want to change the font for a character. Take Papyrus from my Gaster ghost, he talks in the font Papyrus. But I don't want to have to type the tag for it for every line of dialogue he does. So instead I can put it in an envelope.
	  
	  //p
	//	{
	//	"\f[name,Papyrus UT]\f[height,16]"
	//	}
		
		//And then I can make one that'll change the font back to normal.
		
	//	d
	//{
	//"\f[name,default]\f[height,default]"
	//}
	
	//So in dialogue, to change fonts I'd just have to go "%(p)HEY THERE!%(d)" to change fonts back and forth quickly. These kind of shortcuts can be very useful.
	
	//Another way to use envelopes is to store multiple poses for SurfaceRestore in aitalk.dic. Gaster for example has several neutral idle poses, but also several poses for when he's scared. So I can make an envelope like
	
	//scared
	//{
	//"\0\s[9]\i[3]\i[104]\i[39]"
	//"\0\s[100]\i[2]\i[40]\i[104]"
	//"\0\s[100]\i[2]\i[40]\i[106]"
	//}
	
	//And have him randomly pick one whenever I use %(scared) in dialogue. This can be an easy way to vary certain poses without having to manually put them in one at a time, and have some variety when your ghost goes back to its neutral pose in SurfaceRestore.
