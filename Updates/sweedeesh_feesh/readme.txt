Update 10/15/22: Minor updates to clean up code from the jam version. Added the Candy shell!

Initial release: Sweedeesh Feesh - 2022 Ukagaka Dream Team Ghost Jam entry (1 week).

Feesh is a very simple ghost who stands around on your desktop and natters at you now and then! Not much else! It's based on Zarla's "Girl and Triangle" ghost template (YAYA ver, found here: http://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/), with her documentation and commentary left mostly untouched in the .dic files so others new to ghosts can benefit from them as well. 

Base template and balloons: GT template by Zarla (http://www.ashido.com)
