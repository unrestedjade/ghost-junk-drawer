//TODO de-spaghettify (orz), figure out why the nonoverlap isn't working (I may just misunderstand how this is meant to work with pools), figure out why certain eye intervals take priority over others with overlay (212, 220, 216 especially as they were not an issue prior to being animated), add animations and time dialogue for the arrays in word.dic, split dialogue pools into separate functions so aitalk isn't a trillion gd miles long, clean up menu.dic for same reason, write more interactive questions, add in cooldowns for gifting dialogue, tuning for sentiment system (separate T and K's sentiments so some questions can have opposed correct answers?), bulk out smaller pools, add alternate dressup and menu dialogues for variety, dressups spanning multiple intervals (smoky eyes for T could be good starter), more arms and eyes for K, possibly swap tail direction on balloons (￣m￣）

//Leave this alone.
//Advanced users, this is mostly setting up whether or not dialogue is in a chain before it displays. Again, you can leave it alone unless you want to screw around with chains for some strange reason.
